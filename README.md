# Student-Exam-Score-Analysis
### Project Overview
The Student Exam Score Data Analysis project was conducted to examine the performance and factors influencing student exam scores. This analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook, utilizing Python's data science libraries for data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

### Key Steps and Processes

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
   - **Exploring Data:** The project began with loading the dataset into Jupyter Notebook and conducting an initial exploration. This involved checking the data types, summarizing statistics, and identifying key variables such as student demographics, study habits, and exam scores.
   - **Cleaning Data:** Data cleaning involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing data formats. This step was essential to ensure the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Descriptive Statistics:** The first step in EDA was to calculate descriptive statistics to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset's distribution. Metrics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range were computed.
   - **Data Visualization:** Various plots and charts were created to visualize the data. This included histograms to show the distribution of scores, scatter plots to examine relationships between variables, box plots to highlight score distributions among different groups, and heatmaps to display correlation matrices.
   - **Trend Analysis:** The analysis also included identifying trends and patterns within the data, such as the impact of study time, attendance, and socioeconomic factors on exam scores.

3. **Key Findings**
   - **Parent's Education:**
   - The education of parent has a good impact on the student's score
   - **Test Preparation:**
   - There is large impact of "Test Preparation" on the student's score
   
4. **Conclusions and Insights**
   - **Key Findings:** The analysis revealed several key insights, such as the positive correlation between study time and exam scores, the negative impact of absenteeism, and the influence of parental education levels on student performance.
   - **Recommendations:** Based on the findings, recommendations were made to improve student performance, including strategies to increase study time, improve attendance, and provide additional support for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.

### Conclusion
The Student Exam Score Data Analysis project, conducted using Jupyter Notebook, provided a detailed examination of the factors affecting student performance. Through meticulous data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis, the project uncovered significant trends and predictors of exam scores. The insights gained from this analysis offer valuable guidance for educators and policymakers aiming to enhance educational outcomes.
